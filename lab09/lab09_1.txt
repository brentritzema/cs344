a. Linear regression does not do that well. It fails to make much improvement from the initial RMSE and doesn't really seem to converge.
b. L2 loss doesn't strongly differentiate between getting something wrong by a small amount and getting something wrong by a large amount. LogLoss penalizes the model for getting things wrong by a large amount.
c. With the logistic regression method it seems to do a little better, RMSE for logistic regression wasn't all over the place like linear regression was.
d. I got 0.81 and 0.78 for AOC and accuracy by increasing steps to 5000 and batch_size to 200.
