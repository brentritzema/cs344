a. (i) The full size is 25,000 images but we are using 2,000.
   (ii) It is very similar in it's setup, but the inputs are larger and the output has 1 node for output whereas for the one in class it had to choose between 10 different nodes.
   (iii) I noticed that I saw basically full pictures of cats in the intermediate representations. Then as it went lower into the network those pictures turned into lines.
b. (i) Data augmentation is where you randomly transform the input data so that "our model will never see the exact same picture twice".
   (ii) The best I got wsa with 30 epochs and it was 78% accuracy for training and validation. When I increase the epochs to 40 it didn't do well, seemed to be overfitting.
