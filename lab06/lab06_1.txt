Exercise 6.1 (I worked with Roy Adams)

1. I would like it to classify a song as "christian song" or "other" based on things like title, author, and description if it exists.

2. We want it to filter non-christian songs from our radio station.

3. Our success metrics would be whether or not someone complains about the song being non-christian.
   A key result would be a 98% correct classification rate with no false positives.
   Our model would fail if too many false positives occur.

4. Our output would be a 0 or 1
   The output would be defined as 0 to be non-christian and 1 to be christian

5. The output will be needed before the song is played, in real time.
   The output will be consumed by business logic and decide whether or not to play the song.

6. We would use rules such as: if God or Jesus is in the title classify it as christian

7. Our problem is a binary classification problem which predicts Christian or non-christian
   Already binary classification

8. Title      Artist     YouTube_Description        Output(Christian, non-Christian)

9. We will use a music database and it's genre classifications for labels. We can use the Youtube API for the description.

10. We could start with just Artist which would probably be an adequate predictor variable.
