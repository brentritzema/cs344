Exercise 6.2

Information gain from the "Hungry?" question:

Entropy(Restaurant) = -(1/2 * lg(1/2) + 1/2 * lg(1/2)) = 1

Remainder(Hungry) = 7/12 * Entropy(Yes) + 5/12 * Entropy(No)
                  = (7/12 * -(5/7 * lg(5/7) + 2/7 * lg(2/7))) +
                    (5/12 * -(1/5 * lg(1/5) + 4/5 * lg(4/5)))
                  = 0.804

InformationGain(Hungry) = 1 - 0.804 = 0.196
