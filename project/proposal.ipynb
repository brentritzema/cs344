        "The system that I will submit will be a deep neural network that takes raw twitter data, processes it, vectorizes it, and then learns the position of the user based on it. So, in these tweets a user would either be for, against, or neutral on some topic. The system will specifically look at Australian mining companies.\n",

        "The system will use Keras for a densely connected network and character n-grams to avoid spelling errors and decrease training times. A grid search will also be used to find a good size for the network both in layer count and in individual layer size. The goal is to create a system that can then take in new tweets and classify them as either for, against, or neutral in regards to their stance on certain companies."
