a. Compare and contrast categorical vs numerical data:
Categorical data is textual while numerical data is a number.

b. Submit solutions to tasks 1–2. Include your best hyper-parameter values and the resulting RMSE, but not the training output.
Task 1: number of rooms
Best params: learning_rate=0.0001, steps=100, batch_size=1
RMSE: 168.28

Task 2: population
Best params: learning_rate: 0,00004, steps=100, batch_size=1
RMSE: 176.34

c. What are the hyper-parameters learned in these exercises and is there a “standard” tuning algorithm for them?
Hyper-parameters in this exercise were learning-rate, steps, and batch_size. There is no "standard" tuning algorithm, because hyper-parameters are data dependent.
