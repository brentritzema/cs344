a. Submit solutions to tasks 1â€“3.
    Task 1:
    california_housing_dataframe["rooms_per_person"] = (california_housing_dataframe["total_rooms"] / california_housing_dataframe["population"])

    calibration_data = train_model(
        learning_rate=0.048,
        steps=500,
        batch_size=5,
        input_feature="rooms_per_person"
    )

    resulting RMSE: 131.56

    Task 2:
    plt.scatter(calibration_data["predictions"], calibration_data["targets"])

    Task 3:
    clipped_feature = california_housing_dataframe['rooms_per_person'].apply(lambda x: max(x, 10))
    california_housing_dataframe['rooms_per_person'] = clipped_feature

b. What is the purpose of introducing synthetic features?
    Synthetic features allow us to help our model by accounting for multiple features we think may  be useful when used together.

c. What are outliers and what is typically done with them?
    Outliers are data that don't fit in with the rest of the data, and usually they are clipped, or adjusted to fit with a reasonable range with other "normal" data.
