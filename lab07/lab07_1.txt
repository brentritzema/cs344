a.
cities['50sqmi and saint'] = (cities['Area square miles'] > 50) & cities['City name'].apply(lambda city: city.startswith('San'))
cities

cities.reindex([3,2,0,1])
I think this might be allowed because if you allow for null rows, it becomes very easy to add rows where you may not have data for every column.

b.
Pandas seems to have very useful functions for visualizing data, loading data, and manipulating data in ways more conducive to data science.

c.
It would be useful to reshuffle/reindex a dataframe if you wished to perhaps manually sort or create a random permutation of the data to perhaps easily select a random subset.
