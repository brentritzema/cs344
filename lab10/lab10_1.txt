Would you rather use TensorFlow or Keras to build your models?

I think I would rather use Keras as it takes care of a lot of setup and little details that are common between models.

Tasks 1 & 2: Report your best hyper-parameter settings and their resulting performance on the testing dataset.

My hyper-parameters were:
    learning_rate=0.001,
    steps=1500,
    batch_size=100,
    hidden_units=[10, 9],
and my final RMSE was: 109.41
