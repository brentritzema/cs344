Task 1: What does the confusion matrix show for this example?

It shows that the system sometimes mixes up 4 and 9 while also messing up 3 and 8 and 3 and 5.

Task 2: How does the TensorFlow network architecture differ from the Keras example given in class? Report any improvements you can make over the baseline testset accuracy for this task.

This TensorFlow architecture uses a DNN rather than a CNN from the Keras example in class. After adjusting the hyperparameters quite a bit, I wasn't able to improve the accuracy above 0.95.

Task 3: What differences can you see between the visualizations for 10 steps and 1000 steps?

At 10 steps, it all looks like noise, where as at 1000 steps, you can start to see numbers.
