a. Compare and contrast Seaborn vs. MatPlotLib.
Seaborn seems to take care of a lot of labeling for you where MatPlotLib seems much more customizable but also makes complex plots a lot harder to make.

b. How big is this dataset and does it seem of an appropriate size for this problem?
The dataset seems to have 397 entries. It seems appropriate considering it would be harder to get a whole lot more data I believe.

c. Explain what the prescribed normalization of the data does.
It allows us to reduce the possibility that the model depends on the units chosen for our numerical input features.

d. Is this an example of a linear regression model?
It is not a linear regression model since it uses non linear activation functions.

e. In their conclusion, they claim that smaller datasets “prefer” smaller networks. Do you agree? Explain your answer.
I agree with that conclusion because if your network is too large then it could just memorize each example and not generalize, therefore overfitting the data.
