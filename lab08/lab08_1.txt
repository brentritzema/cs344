a. What does the Pearson correlation coefficient measure? Identify one example value from the correlation table you compute and explain why it makes sense.

The Pearson correlation coefficient measures "the linear correlation between two variables X and Y" (from Wikipedia as linked in the exercise).
One example value from the correlation table is the correlation between total_rooms and total_bedrooms which is 0.9. This makes sense because as total_bedrooms increases, total_should as well.

b. Submit your solutions to tasks 1â€“2. Include the features you selected for task 1 and the synthetic features you developed for task 2; include the final RMS errors but not the training output. Did you beat the Google-provided baselines?
Task 1:
minimal_features = [
    "median_income",
    "rooms_per_person",
    "latitude"
]
RMSE = 112.28, which did not beat the google provided baseline that had an RMSE of 111.89.

Task 2:
selected_training_examples = training_examples
selected_validation_examples = validation_examples
selected_training_examples["distance_from_san_francisco"] = abs(selected_training_examples["latitude"] - 38)
selected_validation_examples["distance_from_san_francisco"] = abs(selected_validation_examples["latitude"] - 38)
selected_training_examples["distance_from_LA"] = abs(selected_training_examples["latitude"] - 34)
selected_validation_examples["distance_from_LA"] = abs(selected_validation_examples["latitude"] - 34)

RMSE = 163.88, which did not beat the google provided baseline that had an RMSE of 139.25. This makes sense since their model better represents housing hotspots.
